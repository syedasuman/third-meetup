<strong>Rook</strong>
<p>
	A rook (/rʊk/; ♖,♜) is a piece in the strategy board game of chess. Formerly the piece was called the tower, marquess, rector, and comes (Sunnucks 1970). The term castle is considered informal, incorrect, or old-fashioned.[1][2]

Each player starts the game with two rooks, one on each of the corner squares on their own side of the board.
